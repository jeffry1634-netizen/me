# how make a zettel Entry

this is the body os the zettel (which means "slip")

* First bullet
* Second Bullet

But, when I have an ordered or numebered list:

1 First
2 Second
      
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
   fmt.println("Hello word!")
}
```

what is I want *italic* or **bolt** or ***bolditalic***?

how about something the look like `code`?

And when I have a url I want it to print also so I always write it out like this:

https://rwx.gg

* I put references at the bottom
